# kiwispoofer-crack

classic case of an inexperienced dev (i.e. discord as a CDN and C# loader)

crappy p2c spoofer

This PAID spoofer pasted from https://github.com/alxbrn/gdrv-loader and https://github.com/btbd/hwid

I have gone ahead and removed all remote connections, all spoofer files are now provided with the source.

UPDATE: this spoofer is now detected, and as I predicted, the devs have no idea how to update the source so they have gone ahead and locked all channels in their discord.
